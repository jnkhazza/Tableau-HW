Citi Bike Analysis

**The Final Story board on my Tableau looks normal, but on the web it looks cut off. Please see images for my official view. Thanks!**

**Note: This data is from 2013 and I wrote this as if it is currently the year 2013**

For this assignment I decided to take a closer look at Citi Bike data for July, 2013. I chose July because I figured it would be a very active month for Citi Bike due to better weather and higher tourism during the summer. Looking at this data I recognized that the main distinct demographic groups are based on age and gender. Before creating any data visualizations, some questions came to mind. For gender, my questions were: “Do males tend to ride Citi Bikes longer than females?” and “How does trip duration amongst both genders compare to the amount of rides each gender is taking throughout the month?” For age, my question was: “Are younger age groups riding bikes for longer durations of time than older age groups?” I was also curious to see if older age groups were taking more rides than younger age groups, potentially to avoid longer walks when traveling through NYC. The results were surprising, and the data visualizations can be viewed using the link below:

**Map Analysis**

Looking at the Start/End Station Maps, I didn’t see a concentration of busy stations in any one region. As expected, the busier stations are all in Manhattan, but the most frequently visited stations are pretty spread out. The higher popularity in Manhattan vs. Brooklyn is likely due to population/tourism concentration, as well as the fact that most people who commute to work by bike probably have offices located in Manhattan. I noticed identical patterns and similar consistency between each of the stations for both Starting and Ending rides. Here is a highlight of the most/least frequently visited Start and End stations:

Start:
Top 3 - W 20 St & 11 Ave (8,049), E 17 St & Broadway (7,814), West St & Chambers St. (7,387) 
Bottom 3 - Railroad Ave & Kay Ave (116) Park Ave & St Edwards St (117) 7 Ave & Farragut St (162)

End:
Top 3 - E 17 St & Broadway (8,305) W 20 St & 11 Ave (7,848) West St & Chambers St (7,626) 
Bottom 3 - Park Ave & St Edwards St (127) Railroad Ave & Kay Ave (136) Cadman Plaza E & Red Cross Pl (169)

Citi Bike could potentially do further research into the differences between the most and least used bike stations to see what impacts station popularity. Is it strictly proximity to points of interest in NYC? Or are there other factors that come into play? To increase bike use Citi Bike could work with businesses near bike stations to either advertise or provide incentives for renting Citi Bikes. This could also help increase foot traffic for the businesses. If Citi Bike wanted to expand operations into Brooklyn, they could provide incentives for Brooklynites to subscribe, and build out their network of stations to increase bike use.

**Gender Analysis**

After creating visualizations for the gender data, I realized my initial assumption about trip duration being higher for males was incorrect. When it comes to subscribers, males (511k) strongly outnumber (157k) by more than 3 times. However, females were averaging longer rides for the month of July with an average trip duration of 983 seconds vs males, whose average trip duration is 821 seconds. This led to an analysis on the number of rides being taken by each gender throughout the month, where I found that males outnumbered females every day of the month of July in the number of rides taken. If the data is consistent, then increasing the number of female riders (who tend to ride for longer periods of time) would drastically increase bike use. Previewing our “Age” analysis, I wanted to look at different age groups by gender to get an idea of which age groups were was taking the highest number of rides and the longest rides. The age groups for males taking the longest bike rides were 80-90-year-olds and 90-100-year-olds surprisingly. This could either suggest bad data where people are putting in fake ages, or that older riders are consistently using our bikes more for exercise/getting around the city. For females, I saw a similar trend in older riders, with the 70-80-year-old and 80-90-year-old age groups traveling the longest. An unexpected trend I discovered after looking at the visualizations is that typically on days where bike rentals are down, they are down for both genders, and when bike rentals were up, they were up for both genders. Meaning that there was a consistent pattern of use between males and females. 

Seeing that female riders are taking longer trips on average, but the number of female subscribers is low, Citi Bike can reach out to female residents of NYC to see what would encourage them to use Citi Bike more. Citi Bike could then launch a campaign to encourage women to get around NYC by bike and potentially offer a special subscription deal to increase female sign-ups.   

**Age Analysis**

In order to analyze age, I had to place the Birth Year data I had into 10-year age groups. Going back to the initial pre-visualization analysis, I thought that younger age groups would be using Citi Bikes much more than older age groups. Again, I was proven incorrect. Taking a look at subscriber data I see that 30–40-year-olds and 40–50-year-olds drastically out number other age groups when it comes to subscriptions. Both of these age groups had over 220k subscribers, while all other age groups had below 150k subscribers. Surprisingly the 20–30-year-old age group was towards the bottom and is the second lowest demographic as far as subscribers with just under 9k. This data is consistent with the number of rides by age group, as those age groups with the most subscriptions outnumbered the other age groups in the number of rides taken on a daily basis for the month. However, similar to the results I saw looking at age and gender, the older age groups had higher average trip durations than the younger age groups. 20-30-year-olds were the lowest with an average trip duration of 811 seconds, while 80-90-year-olds had the highest average trip duration of 957 seconds. Again, this could suggest bad data or further prove that older riders are utilizing the Citi Bikes more than the younger riders. 

Citi Bike can also choose to do more research as to why millennials are not using their service as often as older folks in NYC. Is it because people under 30 are using things like Uber, Lyft, or the Subway as their primary transportation? or is it because they are walking more? Citi Bike could target millennials via social media or young professional programs that offer discounts or incentives to use Citi Bikes to commute. Citi Bike also has the opportunity to play on being a source of transportation that is environmentally friendly, which can be appealing to millennials.

**Conclusion**

There were a lot of interesting trends in this data, and it would be valuable to bring in more data from other months to see if the observations made are consistent throughout the year. If Citi Bike has plans to grow operations, they can use the analysis presented to plan out customer research and marketing strategies. These strategies can be tailored to female riders, as well as millennials who are residents of NYC in order to increase subscriptions and bike usage. There are a lot of growth opportunities for Citi Bike and the more invested they get in their customer base, the more they will be able to be a primary source of professional and leisurely transportation for the residents of NYC.
